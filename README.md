### S-T minimum cut algorithm visualizer.

This project demonstrates a visualization of the S-T minimum cut algorithm implemented in JavaScript using own developed simple framework such as React.
<br></br>
To start the test server use the <strong>nmp run dev</strong> command in your terminal.
<br></br>
The developed mini-framework can be used to complement this (with other algorithms) or develop other similar projects.
